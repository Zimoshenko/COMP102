/** The CirclesExercise program is a very simple program that lets the user place small 
 *  and large circles on the graphics pane using the mouse.
 *  It needs a field to remember the size for new circles .
 *  It should have three buttons: Small, Large, and Clear.
 *   The "Small" button should change the size to 10, 
 *   The "Large" button should change the size to 30. 
 *   The "Clear" button should clear the graphics window.
 *  When the user releases the mouse at any point on the graphics pane, the program
 *  should draw a blue circle at that point. The size of the circle should be the remembered size.
